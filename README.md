Introduction
------------

Archive.org's [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org) is a fantastic public resource that archives the web.  The Internet Archive provides [multiple ways](https://help.archive.org/hc/en-us/articles/360001513491-Save-Pages-in-the-Wayback-Machine) of submitting web page URLs for archiving, including a network API.  Multiple open-source programs have been written to take advantage of this API, but many of them no longer work as of late 2020 because of changes in the API.  We wanted a simple, working way of sending batches of URLs to the Wayback Machine, and thus was born this program. 
_Seabass_ (_**Se**nd **A**rchive.org **ba**tche**s** of URL**S**_) is a Python 3 program that reads a list of URLs and submits them for archiving.

Authors and history
---------------------------

I developed the first version of this code while trying unsuccessful to use a number of other similar tools.  Recent changes in the Internet Archive's _Save Page Now_ API meant that most tools did not work.  So I wrote another one!
